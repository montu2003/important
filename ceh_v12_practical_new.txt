Billchiper : use to find exact location of website or ip

check dns zone transfet : dig website.com axfr : if not failed the it is enabled

find how many host is up using nmap : nmap -sn -T4 ip

find domain controller ip : nmap -p 53 -T4 IP

find netbios name : nmap -A IP 

Output look like this : NetBIOS computer name : computer name here(netbios name here)

Finding IP address : Linux : ifconfig
windows : ipconfig


netdiscover : use to find ports on network

netdiscover -r 192.168.77.0/24 : scan entire subnet

question can ask on exam : 

determine what are the machine are running on the given ip or given subnet


NMAP :

first scan network using hostname then scan using ip address

for hostname : nmap google.com
for ip adddress nmap <-Options-here(ex : -sV )>


verbose : -v
double verbose : -vv

scan multiple host : nmap 0.0.0.0 1.1.1.1 2.2.2.2

scan whole subnet using nmap : 192.168.2.0/24

scan custom subnet using nmap :192.168.2.0-20 //this will scan from 0 to 20 subnet of ip

bypass firewall : nmap -sA <ip>

nmap -sL <ip> : ip to domain converter


scan multiple ip : save all ip to a file run this command  : nmap -iL file.txt

tcp syn scan (-sS) :  scan network without three way handshake also this can bypass some firewalls

udp scan ( -sU) : nmap -sU domain name

-sT (check tcp port) : nmap -sT domain.com

pign scan -sn : nmap -sn google.com

-A ( aggressive scan) : tell everyting about network 

what is the os name : nmap -O iphere

web application pentesting :

wpscan : wpscan --url ip-address-here, 
enumurate user on wordpress : wpscan --url ip-add-here -e u


brute force using wpscan : wpscan --url http://ip-here -u username here --password passwordpathlisthere


but most of the time wpscan doesnt work so we can do brute force using metasploit


hydra :

hydra -l username -p password server service


example : hydra -l molly -p butterfly 10.0.10.10 ssh


how to perform brute force using hydra

hydra -L user.txt -p password 10.10.3.7 ssh

dictionary attack : hydra -L user.txt -P /usr/share/rockyou.txt


crack ftp cred usind hydra : hydra -L user.txt -P passsword.txt  ftp://10.10.10.10


For android Hacking 

question : on an android device there is a secret code what is inside the code

5555 port open means that ip is of android device scan that ip usign nmap subnet



connect adb using ip address connect using adb connect 192.168.4.1:5555 command

most of the time file would me in sdcard folder


stegnography 

hide data in txt file : snow -C -m "hidden msg " -p "password" readme.txt redme2.txt //sercret store in redme2.txt

get hidden data : snow -C -p "password" readme2.txt



cryptography : 


there is a secret file inside encrypted drive you have to find out this question can be ask on the exam 

using veracrypt we can find that secret file inside that enxcypted drive we have to do open veracrypt select volume name -->select encrypted drive folder -->click on mount --> enter password which was given in exam


cracking hashes : hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash and crackstation.net this website use to crack hashesh




cracking wifi password


crack a wep network using aircrack-ng


crack a wpa2 network  using aircrack-ng

aircrackng -b [target bssid ] -w [passwwordlist] [wp2 pcap file]


in exam 

we can use this

aircrack-ng -w [ wordlist here ] [pcap file here] if this wont work find bssid using wireshark open that pcap file in wireshark and find bssid 

then use this command


aircrack-ng -b [bssid here] -w [wordlisthere] [pcap file here]
